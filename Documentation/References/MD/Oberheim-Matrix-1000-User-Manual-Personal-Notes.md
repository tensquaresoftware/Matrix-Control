- VCA 1 & VCA 2 are cascaded
- VCA 1 provides the base volume + velocity modulation
- VCA 1 Volume & VCA 1 Mod by Velocity work in tandem
- VCA 2: envelope modulation
- FM Mod By Env 3 & FM Mod By Pressure: cascaded with VCF FM Amount (< DCO 1)
- STRIG: only active if Unison = On (provide GUI logic)
- Legato Portamento: only active if Unison = On (provide GUI logic)
- Env 1/2/3: Amplitude & Amp Mod by Velocity combine
- Matrix Modulation: can program the same slot multiple times for a more powerful modulation effect ! :)
